Starting with eBox 1.1 Alpha, it is possible to set hooks that can be run at several different moments while changes to a module are being saved. Using this feature it is possible to configure a wireless card in an eBox friendly way.

The eBox Network Module provides a helper script called "ebox-setup-wireless" to help us with this task.

If we have an interface called wlan0 that we want to configure, we just need to write a file called /etc/ebox/hooks/network.postsetconf with the following script:

#!/bin/sh

# set WLAN_IFACE to the name of your interface
export WLAN_IFACE=wlan0

# set WLAN_IFACE to the ESSID of your network
export WLAN_ESSID=mindstorm

# set WLAN_CONF to contain any extra configuration needed in /etc/network/interfaces for your 
# interface, for example, uncomment this line if you want to set up
# export WLAN_CONF="wireless-mode master"
# export WLAN_CONF="wpa-conf /root/nloffice.conf"

# execute the helper script
/usr/share/ebox-network/ebox-setup-wireless

# if you need to setup several wireless cards just set the variables and run the script again

# we need to tell ebox we have updated the interfaces file so we are not asked in the interface
# every time we save
/usr/share/ebox/ebox-update-file-digest network /etc/network/interfaces

exit 0
